# code_a_neural_network
Here in this project, I wrote a code in Python where I trained a neural network for the given data coordinates of half a face 
and mirrored image of the remaining face using the trained neural network. I came to find that NN has mirrored the image with great precision and it is hard to find any discrepancies between both parts of a face.
